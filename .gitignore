# Compiled output (if you have an outputs folder for generated files,
# you might want to ignore its contents or specific patterns if they are purely transient)
# Example: /outputs/*.txt (if you want to commit the folder but not .txt files)
# For now, let's assume you want to commit the 'outputs' folder if it's created by save.
# If 'outputs/output.txt' is a *result* you don't want in version control, add:
# outputs/output.txt
# or
# outputs/
